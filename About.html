<H1>About BEARS</h1>

<p>Barnard BEARS: Better, Enhance, and Advance Research Series: a workshop series preparing Barnard undergraduate women for opportunities in Computer Science research. The workshop series will provide Barnard students interested in Computer Science and related majors opportunities to 2) build a self-sustaining and supportive community of peers interested in CS research; 3) understand the ins and outs of CS research and academia;  4) seek out mentors and develop professional relationships; and 5) prepare to apply for and excel in a graduate program. </p>

<p>BEARS is a year long series where students will hear from different women CS faculty at Columbia and Barnard who will discuss the open problems in her subfield, an overview of her research program, and advice for undergraduate women interested in CS research. Participating students will further be placed into peer-networking groups based on their common research interests. Each group will be led by a current woman CS PhD student or postdoc specializing in the groupâ€™s interest area. Each group will meet to discuss the topics about the CS research experience, such as 1) applying to grad school; 2) imposter syndrome; 3) effective collaboration; 4) sexism and racism at work; 5) differences between research and classwork; 6) how to connect with faculty for research opportunities.</p>

<p>The goal of BEARS is to prepare Barnard women for successful careers in computer science (CS) research. BEARS participants will:</p>
<ol> 
<li> Learn technical research skills that are not covered in a traditional CS curriculum </li>
<li> Build a self-sustaining and supportive community of peers interested in CS research</li> 
<li> Understand the ins and outs of CS research and academia</li>
<li> Become prepared to apply for and excel in a graduate program</li> 	
</ol>
