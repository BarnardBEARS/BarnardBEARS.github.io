    research: Katy Ilonka Gero is a fourth year PhD Candidate in Computer Science. She studies human-computer interaction, in particular how computers can support writing forms like poetry, journalism, and science communication. She uses AI methods to augment our abilities, rather than replace them, and considers the ethical implications of this goal, such as how to develop systems capable of responding to a range of inputs safely, and our feelings of ownership and agency when using them.

    research: Caitlin Dreisbach, PhD, RN is currently a postdoctoral research scientist at the Data Science Institute at Columbia. Her research focus is on data-informed women's health including the co-creation of healthcare tools with patients. As a former labor and delivery nurse, Cait is interested in reimagining the current state of fetal monitoring during labor and delivery and using data, in combination with the real-world experiences of women, to enhance to care we provide at the bedside. Cait received her PhD and Master’s in Data Science from the University of Virginia, her Bachelor’s in Nursing from The Johns Hopkins University, and a Bachelor’s of Science from Cornell University.

    research: Mia Chiquier is a first year PhD student in Computer Science at Columbia University, advised by Dr. Carl Vondrick. Her research focuses on integrating multi-sensory information over space and time, with the goal that the learned associations allow machines to understand the dynamics and semantics of their environment effectively and creatively. She previously graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a BS in Computer Science, and minors in Mathematics, Computational Neuroscience and Systems Engineering.
